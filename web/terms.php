          <div class="smenu">
            <a href="#">A Terms and Conditions agreement defines the rules, requirements, acceptable behavior, and other useful terms users must agree to before using your website or mobile app.</a>
            <a href="#">A Terms and Conditions maintains your right to terminate access to your website and gives users notice of acceptable options when using your website.</a>
            <a href="#">Terms and Conditions are also known as Terms of Service or Terms of Use.</a>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="item" id="messages">
          <a href="#messages" class="btn">What can I add in a Terms & Conditions agreement (T&C)?</a>
          <div class="smenu">
            <a href="#">A Terms & Conditions can address any subject matter that affects the use of your website or mobile app:</a>
                <ul class="lists">
            	 	<li>Abuses and illegal activity that leads to termination of accounts</li>

                    <li>Community guidelines</li>

                    <li>Copyright and trademark protection of your resources plus any content uploaded on your website or app</li>
            	</ul>
            	 
            
            <a href="#">Terms and Conditions agreements can vary. For example, a dating app will contain very different rules than one designed for photo sharing.</a>
            <a href="#">That's why you need to create your Terms and Conditions and resist the temptation to borrow one from any other website.</a>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="item" id="settings1">
          <a href="#settings1" class="btn">Is a Terms & Conditions required by law?</a>
          <div class="smenu">
            <a href="#">Unlike Privacy Policies, there are no laws that require you to have a Terms & Conditions agreement.</a>
            <a href="#">However, if you don't have one, you may lack the ability to enforce community guidelines, copyright protection, and other issues that could arise from the use of your website, software or app.</a>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="item" id="settings2">
          <a href="#settings2" class="btn">Why do I need a Terms & Conditions?</a>
          <div class="smenu">
            <a href="#">There are five reasons why a Terms and Conditions is necessary:</a>
            
            <ul class="lists sd">
            	<li>Prevent abuse.</li>
            	  <a href="#">This is especially necessary if your app or website allows for interaction between users</a>
            	  <a href="#">Users will not want to use your website/service or service if defamation, spamming or other abusive behavior is uncontrolled.</a>
            	  <a href="#">Without a Terms & Conditions, you lack the authority to suspend or ban users who display problematic tendencies.</a>
            	  <a href="#">An example of of this is present in the Terms and Conditions agreement of OKCupid, which is managed by Humor Rainbow:</a>
            	<li>Protect your content</li>
            	  <a href="#">As the business owner, you own the logo, content, and design of your website or app. The Terms & Conditions agreement informs users of this fact and prevents them from misappropriating it.</a>
            	<li>Preserve right to terminate.</li>
            	  <a href="#">While termination may be implied in other clauses, having a distinct right outlined in the Terms and Conditions to terminate accounts is better.</a>
            	  <a href="#">A good example is Yahoo which grants this remedy for any violation or breach of its Terms & Conditions:</a>
            	<li>Limit liability</li>
            	   <a href="#">The Terms & Conditions agreement also limits causes of actions your users may attempt to use against you. These limits on liability may address errors in content or system shutdowns</a>
            	   <a href="#">Basically, terms explain that users assume these risks when they sign up for your app, website or service and you cannot be held liable for any losses they sustain in these events.</a>
            	<li>Notice of governing law.</li>
            	   <a href="#">If your company is located in Kenya, it's doubtful that you want to attend an arbitration proceeding in Singapore.</a>
            	   <a href="#">That's where the section on governing law comes in: you state the jurisdiction of your terms and indicate where any dispute resolution must take place.</a>            	
            </ul>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="item" id="settings3">
          <a href="#settings3" class="btn">Are Terms of Service and Terms of Use Agreements different from a Terms & Conditions?</a>
          <div class="smenu">
            <a href="#">These are all the same type of agreement. Terms of Service and Terms of Use indicate rules, limits, and protections just as much as Terms and Conditions.</a>
            <a href="#">The name of the agreement basically depends on the preferences of the business.There's a lot of creativity when it comes to naming Terms and Conditions agreements. As mentioned above, Amazon calls theirs "Conditions of Use".</a>
          </div>
        </li>

        <li class="item" id="settings4">
          <a href="#settings4" class="btn">How can I enforce a Terms & Conditions agreement?</a>
          <div class="smenu">
            <a href="#">There are two steps to assuring enforcement of your Terms & Conditions agreement:</a>
                <ol class="lists" style="a">
                	<li>The first is to confirm acceptance of the terms</li>
                	<li>And the second is being consistent with your enforcement measures.</li>
                </ol>
            <a href="#">You need the user to accept your Terms & Conditions agreement before you enjoy enforcement powers.</a>

            <a href="#">Browsewrap methods makes the Terms & Conditions agreement available to users as they are using your website. However, the clickwrap method means the acceptance of a Terms & Conditions upon registration, creating an account, accessing a certain section of your website/app, and so on.</a>
